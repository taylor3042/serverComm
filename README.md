# Overview

This software as an android app was meant to connect with a WiFi server as an android app, pushing both text and picture to
bits and then through to the WiFi python server.

My purpose for creating this is to progress the big project of my robot. This is a good step in the right direction of later controlling the chassis of the robot and more.

# Development Environment

The tools I used are git, Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, and the Linux OS.

The programming language I used for this was Java for the methods used to connect the WiFi in Android Studio. Python was used as the server to recieve commands.
